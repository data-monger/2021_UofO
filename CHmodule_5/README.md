# Module 5 | Assignment - PyBer

## Overview

Analyze and visualize ride-sharing data using Python, Pandas, and the Matplotlib library to visualize rider-ship trends across the city from Jan to April of 2019.


## Results

Based on the results of the ridership data, Urban ridership is highest amongst the 3, with rural ridership being the lowest.

## Summary

Based on these results, the disparity in ridership volumes seems clear- Rural traffic is significantly lower than urban traffic. Population densities are also higher in Urban area's.

Due to the distances, geographies and terrain of rural area's, the data supports our assumptions that with population densities being significantly lower, a higher percentage of rural families own at least 1 vehicle, if not multiple vehicles. This would also explain lower ridership numbers.

No suggestions can be made here, as these figures coorelate with our assumptions regarding Urban, Suburban, and Rural city types.

Additional clarification is required here, to determine the purpose of the ask; For instance- Is the intent to better schedule drivers for specific city types? Or increase pay for drivers in lower density populations? Or determine whether or not trip prices need to be raised for lower density areas? Shall we create a zone-map to better determine fare pricing? Should we consider the distribution of drivers, and post drivers in fashion that provides all drivers with equal opportunity to run longer rides at the increased fare rate? Should these zones be assigned to more senior drivers? Should the services of rural-trip drivers be decided based on vehicle type? Should services in rural area's be extended to hauling? And conversly, should compact vehicles be restricted to Urban environments?

These are important questions to ask the management team, to best deliver the statisics and metrics that will inform their decision making. At present, the ask doesn't have the specivity required.

In short- the answer can only be as precise as the question.
